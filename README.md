# Individual project HIA302
 
To access horse-colic datasets and understand a way how to replace and reduce missing values in the dataset using Python programming to avoid data discrepancy.
1. To demonstrate ways to convert the horse-colics.txt file into csv file.
2. To replace missing values ('?') with a 'NaN' value in a loaded dataset using python code and save the dataset as horse-colic-with-NaN.csv file.
3. Rename all the header columns following horse.colic.names.txt file with not more than 10 characters and save the dataset as horse-colic-with-title.csv.
4. Load the horse-colic-with-title.csv file and display a list of total NaN at each column in the dataset.
5. Plot the total NaN for each column of the dataset with a bar chart and set the colour to ‘blue’ using Matplotlib library.
6. Show datatypes (e.g. float, integer, object, string etc.) for the dataset.
7. Explain whether it will it be a good idea to delete/drop out the NaN rows and justify.
8. Explain and evaluate the type of method of the code in Fig 1 to reduce the missing value from 1605 to 0, and justify.
9. Fill and complete the inline comments marked with hashtags ‘#’ in lines 8, 11, 17, 20, 22 and 26 from Fig 1 and include the missing codes in lines 5 and 6.
